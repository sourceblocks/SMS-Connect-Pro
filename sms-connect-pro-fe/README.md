## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

List of software and tools required to run the project.

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

Step-by-step guide to install dependencies and set up the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-connect-pro-fe.git
cd sms-connect-pro-fe
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```sh
npm run eject
```

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
